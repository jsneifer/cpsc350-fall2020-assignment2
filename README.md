Assignment 2 (The Game of Life)

The Assignment takes in a board of cells and iterates through their life and death cycles.
Unfortunately, we were unable to get it to run through the game due to some errors we were unable to iron out in time. However, the logic is all there in the code. Our initial plan to use inheritance for the different game modes fell through due to our lack of C++ experience so the code is a little messy.
